# Portfolio
This project is the first milestone in the process of creating portfolio website.

**Tasks that are involved in this project:**
- Understand how to parse a Figma design to create a UI.
- Flexbox to place elements in the page.
- Build a personal portfolio site.
- Use images and backgrounds to enhance the look of the website.

## Built With
- HTML, CSS
- Node js 

## Getting Started
**Requirements:**
- Create a new branch according to the GitHub flow rules.
- Add a .gitignore file.
- Set up a linter for HTML and CSS and make sure that any files that are not relevant are ignored by git.
- Add descriptive README file.
- **The 2 sections that are need to be build for this project are:**
  - The toolbar (or header)
  - The headline section (right after the header)
    - In order to lay out the elements on the page use Flexbox in all 2 sections.
	- No need to implement any functionality that requires JavaScript, like opening the menu or creating dropdowns.
	- Stick to the design as much as possible (e.g. font, colors, images, text, margins) using the templates in Figma.
	- Implement the button interactions (enable, hover, etc.).
- Open a pull request.
